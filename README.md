## Guidance for Monitoring and Optimizing Energy Usage on AWS

The sample code in this project demonstrate a Reinforcement Learning based solution on optimizing energy usage on AWS. 

This RL-based solution can serve as a great starting point for optimizing energy usage for equipment with temperature and humidity sensor readings. You can further optimize this solution to fit your use case, and deploy on AWS to realize cost saving.
